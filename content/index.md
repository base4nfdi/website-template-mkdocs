# Todo4NFDI Documentation 

Welcome to the [Todo4NFDI project page](https://base4nfdi.de/projects/todo4nfdi)! Todo4NFDI is the name of the basic service currently under development. 

This template offers basic service teams to create documentation for the service. It can be also used as a high-level page, similar to our [HuGo template](https://github.com/base4nfdi/website-template-hugo). Ideally, it consists of a landing page from where users are redirected to any part of the documentation or service, but feel free to be creative here. For more recommendations on how to structure the pages, please take a look at our [website policy](https://zenodo.org/records/14245434).

This template relies on substantial work from [IAM](https://iam.services.base4nfdi.de/).
